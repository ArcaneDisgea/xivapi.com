    <h1>API &amp; Developer Keys</h1>

    <p>
        To use the API you must have a valid developer key. This is appended onto any requests
        either via the url or as part of your JSON payload. An API will provide you with your
        rate-limiting and allow you access to the entire API.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #16a23d;">
        You can get a key from: <a href="{{ path('app') }}">Apps</a>
    </p>

    <br>

    <h4>Usage</h4>
    <p>You can use it in the url as a GET param:</p>
    <code class="box">
        https://xivapi.com/item/1675?<em>key=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8</em>
    </code>

    <p>You can also pass it as a JSON payload</p>
    <code class="box">
        <pre>{
    key: <em>"a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8"</em>
}</pre>
    </code>

    <h4>Rate Limiting</h4>
    <p>
        The API will deny requests that go above your rate limit. A new key will have a limited
        amount of requests for the first hour, then it will be bumped to a full app amount.
    </p>

    <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td width="25%"><strong>Limited</strong></td>
            <td>2 requests a second</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Full</strong></td>
            <td>10 requests a second</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">
                <small>If you need more, please talk to <strong>@vekien</strong> on Discord.</small>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    {{ docs.gap() }}

    <h4>Burst</h4>
    <p>
        Your burst is 2x your rate limit until you hit your burst then it will reduce
        to your normal rate limit. Once 5 seconds of no traffic has occurred from the
        same source your burst will go back up to 2x your rate limit.
    </p>
    <p>To illustrate this, Imagine these requests with a 5/req/second limit:</p>
    <div class="rate-limit-example">
        <div>Request 1 &nbsp;@ 0 second - OK</div>
        <div>Request 2 &nbsp;@ 0 second - OK</div>
        <div>Request 3 &nbsp;@ 0 second - OK</div>
        <div>Request 4 &nbsp;@ 0 second - OK</div>
        <div>Request 5 &nbsp;@ 0 second - OK</div>
        <div>Request 6 &nbsp;@ 0 second - OK  - Burst</div>
        <div>Request 7 &nbsp;@ 0 second - OK  - Burst</div>
        <div>Request 8 &nbsp;@ 0 second - OK  - Burst</div>
        <div>Request 9 &nbsp;@ 0 second - OK  - Burst</div>
        <div>Request 10 @ 0 second - OK  - Burst</div>
        <div>Request 11 @ 0 second - Rate Limited</div>
        <div>Request 12 @ 1 second - OK</div>
        <div>Request 13 @ 1 second - OK</div>
        <div>Request 14 @ 1 second - OK</div>
        <div>Request 15 @ 1 second - OK</div>
        <div>Request 16 @ 1 second - OK</div>
        <div>Request 17 @ 1 second - Rate Limited</div>
        <div>Request 18 @ 1 second - Rate Limited</div>
        <div>Request 19 @ 1 second - Rate Limited</div>
        <div>Request 20 @ 1 second - Rate Limited</div>
    </div>

    <h4>Google Analytics</h4>
    <p>
        The API allows you track your requests using Google Analytics, this provides you all
        the nice real-time, historic hits and event tracking out the box.
    </p>
    <p>
        Create a new property in your Google Analytics and attach the Tracking ID to your app dashboard.
    </p>
